Hyper-detailed, 8K photorealistic developer workspace. A warm, polished wooden desk with subtle grain texture holds an open laptop displaying clean, modular PHP code (syntax-highlighted, organized into classes/folders). Beside it, a closed minimalist notebook with a black pen resting on top. A white ceramic 'CastLivre' coffee mug (slightly steaming) sits nearby. No keyboard visibleâ€”focus on the screen and objects. Soft, volumetric ambient lighting (golden-hour glow) illuminates the scene, casting gentle shadows.
Background: A blurred, textured wall with faint wireframe diagrams (UI flows, database schemas) in low-opacity blueprints. Atmosphere: Professional yet cozy, with warm tones (amber, walnut, cream). Style: Ultra-realistic, podcast-cover-worthy, 8K textures, cinematic depth of field. Aspect ratio: 1:1.
